Living in a world where AI is everywhere feels both exciting and scary at the same time. 
As an IT student, I use AI almost every day for schoolwork, coding, and organizing tasks. 
Sometimes it makes things easier, but there are moments when I feel like I depend on it too much. 
In this blog, I will share my personal experience on how AI is impacting my life as an IT student today.

From my experience, AI makes my IT life easier in many ways. Whenever I struggle with coding or understanding errors, AI helps guide me in the right direction. It saves me time by summarizing lessons and giving suggestions that help me finish tasks faster.

However, using AI too much also has disadvantages. There are times when I stop thinking deeply and wait for AI to give me the answer. I realized that this habit affects my creativity and problem-solving skills.

For me, AI should be treated as a tool and not a replacement for my own skills. Real learning happens when I try to solve problems on my own first.

In conclusion, AI has a big impact on my life as an IT student. It helps me work faster, but it also challenges my creativity. Moving forward, I plan to balance independent learning with AI support only when needed.
