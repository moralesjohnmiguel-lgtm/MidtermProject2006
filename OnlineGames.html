During the pandemic, online games became a big part of my daily routine. Since I did not have a PC or laptop at the time, mobile games were my main source of entertainment. These games helped me pass the time during long days at home and even allowed me to meet new friends online. Because I enjoyed them so much, I often spent many hours playing without realizing how long I had been staring at my phone screen.

The reason these games became so addictive was because they were fun and competitive. I enjoyed the challenge of improving my skills and working together with other players. Through these games, I learned useful skills such as teamwork, strategy, communication, and quick decision making.

However, playing for too many hours eventually affected my health, especially my eyesight. At first, I did not notice anything unusual. But when face-to-face classes resumed during senior high school, I realized something was wrong. I could not see clearly from a distance and everything in front of me looked blurry. After experiencing this for several days, I asked my parents if I could get eyeglasses. Convincing them was difficult because they did not believe I needed them since they themselves did not wear glasses.

From this experience, I learned the importance of controlling how much time I spend playing games. Even though gaming can be fun and relaxing, too much screen time can affect our health. It is important to take breaks and balance entertainment with other responsibilities.

Looking back, gaming during the pandemic gave me many good memories and friendships. However, it also taught me an important lesson about moderation and self discipline. Moving forward, I plan to manage my gaming time better while focusing more on my studies and personal growth.
